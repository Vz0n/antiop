# AntiOP

A simple plugin that helps to protect against some types of Minecraft vanilla operator system abuse.

The plugin has 3 available modes to work: LIST, CONSOLE
and DISABLED. Meaning of all modes are explained in the config.

# Modifying/Compiling

If you want to modify the source code of the plugin, then you will need to
clone this repo using `git` and do the changes. To compile the jar just run `./gradlew build` on a console in the source directory.

# Note from author

This was originally intended to be used on a network called "MonkeyCraft" and published on SpigotMC, but how I never updated
it again and the guy who asked me for this never told something about again, I made the repository public.

Also don't expect something "professional", this is just a private plugin that I made for someone in 2022 and
personally, I don't think my code is good compared to the stuff that you can find around GitHub.
